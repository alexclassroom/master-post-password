# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Add a filter at the point at which a master password is being authenticated for use. Would facilitate the ability to log who, when, and where a master password is being used.
* Add multiple password fields, or at least support adding multiple passwords. Maybe just use a textarea as the input field. That allows for multiple passwords to be in use (e.g. given to different users or groups of users) and then revoked without needing everyone to be notified of a change to the password.
* Re: previous - some way of leaving a note for context about given password? e.g. "pw given to john", "pw given to the 2020 training class". Each password could be an input with associated optional input field. Or in the texarea approach, could separate password from comment, e.g. "this-is-the-password # And this is comment"

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/master-post-password/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/master-post-password/) as an issue or PR).
